# Latent KMeans Prototype Selection for Nearest Neighbor Classifier

Choosing a representative subset of "prototypes" from the training set is crucial for accelerating nearest neighbor classifiers. This project proposes projecting the data into a latent space using a pretrained embedder, applying in-class KMeans Clustering to the latent representations and taking the clustering centers as the selected prototypes. Experiments demonstrate that the performance of the nearest neighbor classifier with latent KMeans clustering prototypes significantly outperforms other baselines, even with a training set containing as few as 10 points. An ablation study on the embedder's pretraining domain reveals taht using in-domain data for training greatly affects the quality of the representations.
